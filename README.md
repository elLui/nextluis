Elluis.codes - A Personal Blog and Portfolio Website ðŸš€


This project showcases my work and thoughts as a developer ðŸ’». It's a platform for me to express myself, share my
experiences, and present my portfolio ðŸ’¼.

API Routes ðŸ”—
API routes can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js. The
pages/api directory is mapped to /api/* and treated as API routes instead of React pages.

Optimized Fonts ðŸŽ¨
This project uses next/font to optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font. This ensures a smooth and stylish reading
experience for all visitors.
